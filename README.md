# E-Commerce Back End

## Description
---
A working back end for an e-commerce site using Express.js API and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## How to Use
---
**IMPORTANT:** You will need to create and populate your local .env file with your MySQL username and password in the root folder.

1. You will need to install all of the required ```npm``` modules by running ```npm install```.
2. You will need to implement the ```schema.sql``` script using your local MySQL server and running ```source db/schema.sql```
3. You will need to seed the database by running ```npm run seed```
4. You can run the application using ```npm start``` or ```node server.js```

## Design Requirements

### User Story

```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```

### Mock-Up

The following animation shows the application's GET routes to return all categories, all products, and all tags being tested in Insomnia:

![In Insomnia, the user tests “GET tags,” “GET Categories,” and “GET All Products.”.](./Assets/13-orm-homework-demo-01.gif)

The following animation shows the application's GET routes to return a single category, a single product, and a single tag being tested in Insomnia:

![In Insomnia, the user tests “GET tag by id,” “GET Category by ID,” and “GET One Product.”](./Assets/13-orm-homework-demo-02.gif)

The following animation shows the application's POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories being tested in Insomnia:

![In Insomnia, the user tests “DELETE Category by ID,” “CREATE Category,” and “UPDATE Category.”](./Assets/13-orm-homework-demo-03.gif)

Your walkthrough video should also show the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for products and tags being tested in Insomnia.


### Database Models

The following describe the database schema:

* `Category`

  * `id`

    * Integer.
  
    * Doesn't allow null values.
  
    * Set as primary key.
  
    * Uses auto increment.

  * `category_name`
  
    * String.
  
    * Doesn't allow null values.

* `Product`

  * `id`
  
    * Integer.
  
    * Doesn't allow null values.
  
    * Set as primary key.
  
    * Uses auto increment.

  * `product_name`
  
    * String.
  
    * Doesn't allow null values.

  * `price`
  
    * Decimal.
  
    * Doesn't allow null values.
  
    * Validates that the value is a decimal.

  * `stock`
  
    * Integer.
  
    * Doesn't allow null values.
  
    * Set a default value of `10`.
  
    * Validates that the value is numeric.

  * `category_id`
  
    * Integer.
  
    * References the `Category` model's `id`.

* `Tag`

  * `id`
  
    * Integer.
  
    * Doesn't allow null values.
  
    * Set as primary key.
  
    * Uses auto increment.

  * `tag_name`
  
    * String.

* `ProductTag`

  * `id`

    * Integer.

    * Doesn't allow null values.

    * Set as primary key.

    * Uses auto increment.

  * `product_id`

    * Integer.

    * References the `Product` model's `id`.

  * `tag_id`

    * Integer.

    * References the `Tag` model's `id`.

**Model Associations:**

* `Product` belongs to `Category`, and `Category` has many `Product` models, as a category can have multiple products but a product can only belong to one category.

* `Product` belongs to many `Tag` models, and `Tag` belongs to many `Product` models. Allow products to have multiple tags and tags to have many products by using the `ProductTag` through model.
